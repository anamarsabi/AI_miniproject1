## Task

For a graph describing the street network of a given city, develop a route mapping method for
pizza delivery.
Input:
- filele with a graph describing the city map
- he node in which the pizzeria is, vp
- list of edges to which the pizzas need to be delivered z(, … , z9 (we assume that the supplier of needs to visit each of these).
Output: the supplier's route in the form of a list of vertices to visit, which begins and ends at node vp

To deliver the pizzas in the corresponding edges and go back to the pizzeria having traversed the minimum distance possible.
The output will be a list of the vertices visited in the optimized order for going through the pizza
delivery locations.
